Example on using Lambda with CloudFormation, to create an patch baseline via Systems Manager, and set it to the default patch baseline.

To use, execute `./create-stack.sh mypatchbaseline` to create a new CloudFormation stack called mypatchbaseline in the US-EAST-1 region. Or, use the console to create a stack using templates/baseline.template.yaml file.

Other files here assist quick testing outside of CloudFormation as well.
